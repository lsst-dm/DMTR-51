Operational concerns
\begin{itemize}
  \item Missing handoff process from Pipelines to Operations.
  \item Generic issues
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The workflow definition (wcl) is very fragile to any stack
	  code changes. For example, in the current task framework,
	  a config change can imply a change in the science workflow,
	  so even a seemingly simple config change can make wcl
	  outdated. With this caveat, long pipeline integration
	  time is needed to run a version of pipelines through the
	  processing framework. It is time-consuming to keep pipeline
	  workflow definitions up to date with the Stack development.
          No verification is done to ensure complete consistency.
    \item The typical usage of Butler means all filenames are
	  pre-determined in the Stack, which leads to the situation
	  that filenames are not unique and conflicts with the DBB
	  design. To customize the filenames, a Butler template
	  file is made manaully to provide a customized Butler
	  configuration file built for each processing attempt (via
	  the \texttt{desdmfw{\_}lsst{\_}plugins} pacakge; DMTN-059).
	  This manually-made Butler template needs to match the
	  workflow definition (wcl). So far this is done manually
	  and is very error-prone.  Better integration between the
	  Butler interface and the processing framework will be helpful.
    \item As our usage of Butler is not standard and well tested,
	  it is fragile to any changes in Butler implementations
	  and the integration time can be long.
    \item Inconsistent naming
          Table \ref{tab:name}
          \input{tableNaming.tex}
    \item Storing metadata to database
  \end{itemize}
  \item Infrastructure issues
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Uptime of cluster, problems with GPFS
    \item Storage space, compete with developer cluster use
    \item Busy cluster (fix: special reservations/queue)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Missing overall processing strategy
  \item Issues specific to DESDM software
  \begin{itemize}
    \item begblock scaling
    \item restart unit is per tract
    \item The cleanup of files that are no longer needed is manual and done by operator
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

For LDM-503-2, some tests were carried out manually through spot checks.
Improvements and development of tools to perform the checks will be helpful.

\section{Detailed Test Results \label{sect:detailed}}
This section describes more in detail the results of those test cases that are failed or need a more detailed revision.
\subsection{[TEST-ID]}
\subsubsection{Summary of test results}
This paragraph shall summarize the results of the test. When the completion status of the test is not 'PASS', this section
shall reference the following paragraphs for details.

\paragraph{[DRP-00-05]}
Basic data completeness and integratiry checks from LDM-534 4.2.8.3
\begin{itemize}
  \item check the existence of the expected data
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Table \ref{tab:count} listing all release data products per tract:  expected counts, actual counts, number with 0 filesizes for that datasetType
    \input{tableProductCounts}
    \item To verify the physical location of files on the filesystem
	  match the location information tracked in the archive
	  database in the Data Backbone, we used the tool
	  \texttt{compare{\_}db.py} from the \texttt{FileMgmt}
	  package.  Paths, filesize, and md5sum were compared. The
	  results were all equal for all 50656 files in tract=8766,
	  52041 files in tract=8767, and 273375 files in tract=9813.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Check existence metadata
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Table \ref{tab:metadata} shows the metadata we check for each data product type, such as visit, ccd, tract IDs.
\input{tableProductMetadata}
    \item Results of test (Non-null values in appropriate DB table for each file)
    \item DatasetType Expected Metadata num of files with NULLs for each Metadata
  \end{itemize}
  \item Check existence provenance ((shortcut) by attempt, OPM WAS GENERATED BY, OPM WAS USED BY)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Verify each file can be linked with the step and processing attempt
          (Check for null pfw{\_}attempt{\_}id entry in desfile)
          (Check for null wgb{\_}id entry in desfile (and wgb{\_}id is in correct attempt)
    \item Verify information linking input files to each step was saved to Oracle
          (Check that at least 1 file of each input dataset type was tracked as input for each step based upon science description of pipeline - Bonus if we can check 1 vs > 1)
    \item (known products from each pipeline: https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/~hchiang2/Notes+on+existing+pipeline+components )
    \item Attach a full graph (graphml format) for the small tract?
  \end{itemize}
  \item Check (existence) runtime metrics
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For each tract, wallclock time vs exec totals vs overheads
    \item For each tract + executable, sum wallclock times, avg memory usage
    \input{tableRuntime.tex}
    \input{tableRuntimeExec.tex}
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Problems encountered}
\paragraph{[TEST-CASE-ID]}
This paragraph shall identify by their unique identification, the test cases in which one or more problems occurred, and shall provide:
\begin{itemize}
\item A description of the problem that occurred
\item Identification of the test procedure step in which it occurred
\item Reference to the Mantis issue
\item The number of times the procedure or step was repeated in attempting to correct the problem and the outcome of each attempt (if applicable)
\item Test steps where tests were resumed for retesting (if applicable)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{[DRP-00-05]}

\begin{itemize}
  \item During execution (LDM-534 \S 4.2.8.2), several processing
	attempts failed due to unstable GPFS availability resulted
	from hardware problems and network issues. We retried the
	attempts after the transient problems were resolved, following
	the Test Specifications.
  \item The scratch filesystem, where the prototype DBB stores the
	files, was close to full several times during test execution.
	We had to manually purge files to ensure sufficient space
	for the execution.
  \item We needed to apply a patch on top of the Stack release to
	workaround the issue that commas are part of the data IDs;
	this has been a known problem as discussed in \jira{RFC-361}.
	The fix has been agreed in RFC-365 for future implementation
	in \jira{DM-11874}, \jira{DM-11875}, and \jira{DM-11876}.

\subsubsection{Deviations from test cases/procedures}
\paragraph{[TEST-CASE-ID]}
This paragraph shall identify by their unique identification, the test cases in which one or more deviations occured and shall provide:
\begin{itemize}
\item A description of the deviation (e.g. substitution of any resource, procedural step not followed, scchedule deviation, etc)
\item The rationale of the deviation
\item An assessment of the deviation impact on the validity of the test case
\end{itemize}

\section{Test Review Board Declaration\label{sect:trb}}
This section must be filled only if the test campaign has a  formal
test review board.
After the tests are executed and the test team circulates a draft of
this document the TRB meets to declare the completion of the test campaign.
This section must contain this declaration and the pass of fail status
of the tests after completion (in case of failing it should also account
for the actions taken - Mantis issues, etc.)

\appendix
\section{ANNEX A: Unit Tests \label{sect:unit_tests}}
Description of the unit test coverage given by Cobertura

\newpage
\section{ANNEX B: Patch releases verification}

{\it describe here the test activities executed in order to garantee the quality of the patch release}

\subsubsection{Patch release C.M.n}

Due to the small number issues fixed with the {\it \product} patch release {\it C.M.n} (very short jira list)
and due to the minimal changes applied to the software, the test campaign completed for the {\it \product} major
release $C.M$ is still valid.

All unit and integration tests are still running without problems.

Following manual verification has been done:

\begin{itemize}
\item verification 1
\item ...
\end{itemize}

No system test has been re-executed, but the fix has been verified with a specific run
on {\it Enclave??} platform.
