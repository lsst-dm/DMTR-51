\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}

\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sect:objectives}

This document describes the results of tests carried out in late (calendar) 2017 on the \product{} in order to assess progress against the LSST DM level 2 milestone \milestoneId{}.
We report on the success or failure of applicable test cases and assess the state of the software and services tested.

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sect:scope}

The overall test plan for the LSST Data Management system is described in \citeds{LDM-503}.
This document specifically refers to the late (calendar) 2017 milestone \milestoneId{}, which tests the \product{}.
The overall \product{} test specification is defined in \citeds{LDM-534}.
The test plan for \milestoneId{} involves the execution of the entire DRP-00
(Small Scale Data Release Processing) specification, including the following
test cases:

\begin{description}

  \item[DRP-00-00]{Installation of the Data Release Production science payload}
  \item[DRP-00-05]{Execution of the DRP Science Payload by the Batch Production Service}
  \item[DRP-00-10]{Data Release Includes Required Data Products}
  \item[DRP-00-15]{Scientific Verification of Source Catalog}
  \item[DRP-00-20]{Scientific Verification of Forced Source Catalog}
  \item[DRP-00-25]{Scientific Verification of Object Catalog}
  \item[DRP-00-30]{Scientific Verification of Processed Visit Images}
  \item[DRP-00-35]{Scientific Verification of Coadd Images}

\end{description}

\subsection{System Overview}
\label{sect:systemoverview}

The \product{} is that part of the LSST Data Management system which will be responsible for scheduled, periodic data processing during LSST operations.
The most prominent example of such processing is the generation of LSST's annual releases of both catalog and image data.
However, the \product{} is also responsible for the generation of template images (used in the nightly processing system) and calibration products (used in both nightly and annual processing), and for the Level 2 Quality Control Service (\citeds{LDM-148}).
The \milestoneId{} milestone focuses only on the data release production part of the system.

Note that we may broadly think of the \product{} as consisting of two independent parts: the Batch Production Service, which provides scheduling and workflow services, and the Science Payloads, which contain the algorithmic content.
The \milestoneId{} milestone exercises both parts of the system.

\section{Test Configuration}
\label{sect:configuration}

\subsection{Documents}

This test report refers to the execution of tests DRP-00-00 through DRP-00-35 in \citeds{LDM-534}.

\begin{note}
At time of writing, LDM-534 has not been baselined, so a detailed version
number is not available.
\end{note}

\subsection{Hardware}
\label{sect:hwconf}

All tests were executed on systems in the LSST Data Facility.

Software installation (DRP-00-00) and scientific analysis work (DRP-00-10 through DRP-00-35) were carried out on \texttt{lsst-dev01.ncsa.illinois.edu}.
At time of text execution, this was a Dell PowerEdge R730 with 24 physical Intel Xeon E5-2690v3 CPU cores at 2.60\,GHz and 256\,GB of RAM.

Bulk data processing (DRP-00-05) was carried out on the LSST Verification Cluster (VC).
At the time of test execution, the VC provided 48 Dell C6320 nodes, each with 24 physical Intel Xeon E5-2680v3 CPU cores at 2.50\,GHz and 128\,GB of RAM.

\subsection{Software}
\label{sect:swconf}

All systems used for testing --- including both \texttt{lsst-dev01} and the VC nodes --- were running CentOS Linux release 7.4.1708.
The \texttt{devtoolset-6}\footnote{\url{https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_developer_toolset/6/html/6.0_release_notes/}} toolchain, including GCC\footnote{\url{https://gcc.gnu.org/}} version 6.3.1, was enabled throughout these tests.

\subsection{Input Data}
\label{sect:inputdata}

Input data for all tests was based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam “RC1” dataset, as described in the appendix to \citeds{LDM-534}.
Calibration dataset 20170105 was used, defined as per \citeds{DMTR-31}.

\section{Personnel}
\label{sect:personnel}

Test case DRP-00-00 was executed by John Swinbank (University of Washington).

Test case DRP-00-05 was executed by Hsin-Fang Chiang (NCSA), Michelle Butler (NCSA), Mikolaj Kowalik (NCSA), Greg Daues (NCSA) and Rob Kooper (NCSA).

Test cases DRP-00-10, DRP-00-15, DRP-00-20, DRP-00-25, DRP-00-30 and DRP-00-35 were executed by Jim Bosch (Princeton), Lauren MacArthur (Princeton) and Tim Morton (Princeton).

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Impact of Test Environment}
\label{sect:impact}

The DRP-00-05 test was performed --- as per its specification --- using the DESDM framework, as described in \citeds{DMTN-059}.
The DESDM system is still under evaluation for use within LSST data processing, and may not be deployed during operations.
The results of this test therefore establish a baseline system, rather than testing a true operational deployment.

\subsection{Recommended Improvements}
\label{sect:recommendations}

\subsubsection{Operational}

\begin{itemize}

  \item{
    For \milestoneId{}, some tests were carried out manually through spot checks.
    Further development of verification tools to perform these and additional checks is needed.
  }

  \item{
    The handoff process from Pipelines to the Data Facility needs to be improved.
    Improvements include providing details about changes in the codebase.
    Currently the operator is digging through \texttt{pipe{\_}drivers} code to figure out some of these details in addition to repeatedly consulting pipeline developers.
    Providing change details during handoff will not only speed up configuring and executing the pipeline, but will also provide the information needed to configure the verification tests themselves.
    The Data Facility should provide a first proposal on what information they would like provided.
  }

  \item{
    Making what can seem like minor changes to the pipeline definition can require more integration time.
    Examples of pipeline changes that affect the pipeline execution configuration and verification tests:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item{Pipeline code changes or task configuration changes can alter the required input files or what output files are created.}
      \item{Changing what pipeline steps should be executed may require a pipeline task configuration change in addition to modifying the overall pipeline definition.}

    \end{itemize}

    One of the goals of the new Butler and SuperTask effort is to minimize the amount of integration effort.
    When running the exact same configuration as the developer, the new Butler and SuperTask effort could definitely help.
    However, it is not yet clear how much integration/configuration effort will still be required with the new Butler+SuperTask if the operator wishes to run something different than the default pipeline configuration.
  }

  \item{
    At the time of this test, it is not yet understood exactly how the Data Facility would configure the execution of the pipeline for best scalability and management.
    This execution may not match small-scale developer tests where getting individual results faster is more important.
    The desire is to have the test match the expected release campaign execution configuration
  as much as possible.
    As work is done on both the pipeline science and the Batch Processing Service, effort should be undertaken to determine the release campaign execution configuration.
  }

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Infrastructure}

Problems with the Verification Cluster infrastructure were encountered during the execution of DRP-00-05 as described in \S\ref{sect:problems-drp-00-05}.
These problems may be mitigated by increasing the scratch storage space available on the cluster and adding dedicated production job queues to the Slurm system for future tests.

\subsubsection{DESDM Execution Framework}

A number of improvements to the DESDM framework are suggested by this work.
These include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{
    The step in DESDM framework which configures each step for each compute job does not scale well at the size of the larger tract.
    In DESDM Operations the unit of work in a single submission is smaller, so this has not been an issue there.
    For short term use, this code could be profiled to see if there are straight forward ways to speed it up.
  }

  \item{
    In DESDM Operations, the single submission's unit of work is chosen to be the amount of work the operator is willing to start over from the beginning.
    In this test, this unit of work is tract using the current operational configuration of the pipeline.
    Restarting a tract from the very beginning adds a lot of extra compute time and resources to complete the test (especially when including the scaling issue
mentioned in the previous item).
    Short term solutions include modifying operational configuration of the pipeline to make smaller units of work (which currently means human overhead in managing more submissions).
    Also, DESDM allows for manually starting a pipeline execution using outputs in the Data Backbone from a previous submission.
    But this requires an operational pipeline configuration change which takes human knowledge, effort and time.
  }

  \item{
    The workflow definition (wcl) that describes a pipeline to the DESDM framework includes how to name output files.
    These naming patterns need to match the manually-made Butler policies.
    For this test, this was done manually and was very error-prone.
    Until this issue is resolved by the Batch Processing Service integrating
    updated DM Middleware (following \citeds{LDM-556}), modifying the DESDM framework to automatically create the Butler policy file from the pipeline definition would speed up the integration process.
  }

\end{itemize}

At the time of writing, the long term execution framework for LSST processing has not yet been selected; we note that it may make sense only to implement these improvements to DESDM if it is ultimately chosen for this role.

\section{Detailed Test Results}
\label{sect:detailed}

\subsection{DRP-00-00}

The string \texttt{Ok} was returned when executing

\begin{verbatim}
  $ python bin/compare expected/Linux64/detected-sources.txt
\end{verbatim}

after running the \texttt{demo.sh} on both the cluster head node (\texttt{lsst-dev01}) and on an example compute node.


\subsection{DRP-00-05}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item{Check the existence of the expected files: PASSED}

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item{
      Table \ref{tab:count} list all release data products per tract.
      For each product, we provide the expected number of files to be generated (where available) and the number of files gneerated in practice.
      Each of these files was checked to ensure that it contained some data (i.e., the size of the file was non-zero).}

    \item{
      To verify the physical location of files on the filesystem match the location information tracked in the Data Backbone database tables, we used the tool
	  \texttt{compare{\_}db.py} from the DESDM \texttt{FileMgmt} package.
      Paths, file sizes, and checksums (MD5) were compared.
      The test results were that both the database and filesystem matched with 50656 files in tract 8766, 52041 files in tract 8767, and 273375 files in tract 9813.
    }
  \end{enumerate}

  \item{
    Check existence of the expected metadata: PASSED\\
    The following metadata is expected to have been saved

    \begin{itemize}
      \item{calexp: tract, visit, filter, ccd}
      \item{deepCoadd\_calexp: tract, patch, filter}
    \end{itemize}

    It was verified that the above mentioned metadata had non-NULL values stored for the data products in the Data Backbone database tables.
  }

  \item{
    Check existence of the expected provenance: PASSED

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item{Table \ref{tab:provenance} shows that each file can be linked with the step and processing attempt.}
      \item{Via manual spot checks, it was verified that information linking input files to each step was saved to the Data Backbone database tables.}
    \end{enumerate}
  }

  \item{Check (existence) runtime metrics: PASSED

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item{Table \ref{tab:runtime} shows wallclock time for running the entire pipeline for each tract and total cpu time per execution.}
      \item{Table \ref{tab:runtimeExec} provides details of execution time and memory usage at a per-process level.}
    \end{enumerate}
  }
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Problems encountered}

\paragraph{DRP-00-00}

None.

\paragraph{DRP-00-05}
\label{sect:problems-drp-00-05}

\begin{itemize}

  \item{
    During execution (LDM-534 \S 4.2.8.2), several processing attempts failed due to unstable GPFS availability resulted from hardware problems and network issues.
    We retried the attempts after the transient problems were resolved, following the Test Specifications.
    The Data Facility's Network Group replaced the broken routers and purchased a hot spare.
  }

  \item{
    The scratch filesystem, where the prototype DBB stores the files, was close to full several times during test execution.
	We had to manually purge files to ensure sufficient space for the execution.
  }

  \item{
    The Verification Cluster can be very busy making it difficult to acquire nodes to do the test work (both initial configuration test and actual full test).
  }

  \item{
    We needed to apply a patch on top of the Stack release to workaround the issue that commas are part of the data IDs; this has been a known problem as discussed in \jira{RFC-361}.
	The fix has been agreed in RFC-365 for future implementation in \jira{DM-11874}, \jira{DM-11875}, and \jira{DM-11876}.
  }

  \item{
    The current implementation of the ``Data Butler'' I/O abstraction in the DM Stack is hard to adapt to the Data Backbone and DESDM framework in use for this test.
    This caused lengthy integration issues and fragility in the system design.
    It is expected that future work on the DM middleware will resolve these concerns (\citeds{LDM-556}).
  }
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Deviations from test cases/procedures}

\paragraph{DRP-00-00}

None.

\paragraph{DRP-00-05}
\label{sect:deviation-drp-00-05}

\begin{itemize}
  \item{
    For the first processing attempts of tracts 8766 and 8767, there was a misconfiguration which executed both attempts on the same set of worker nodes simultaneously.
    This does not match the procedure in the Test Specification.
    While tract 8766 finished successfully, it took longer wallclock time than expected.
    Because it produced expected outputs, tract 8766 was not rerun.
    The first attempt of tract 8767 failed due to a network problem, and the time reported in Table \ref{tab:runtime} is the result of a new attempt (based on the Test Specification regarding resubmission of intermittent infrastructure problems) configured correctly using non-shared nodes.
    Thus, the wallclock time for tract 8767 in Table \ref{tab:runtime} is closer to the expected
	time.
  }
